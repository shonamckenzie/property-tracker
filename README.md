# property-tracker

Make a table for tracking properties for sale and let.

An entry in the properties table must have a selection of 4 of these properties:

- address
- value
- number of bedrooms
- year built
- buy/let status
- square footage
- build (detached, semi-detached, flat, etc)

## Your property class should have:

1. Full CRUD functionality
2. The ability to find properties by id
3. The ability to find properties by address
